BoR (Band of Robots)
====================

# Introduction

## What is the project about?
The project aims to create a collection of robot musicians made with the EV3 that form a band or orchestra. The musicians do not actually play the music, this is done by a computer. But they all have an instrument and it looks like they are playing it as they move in rhythm with the actual music. Very much like the Bimboboxes I used to love when I was young (although I doubt that they are called Bimboboxes in english).

## How does it work?
The robots will be controlled via a Midi file. Each robot in the band is assigned one (or more) instruments that make up the music score. While the computer plays the music that midi events that make up the music are also sent to the robots. The robots act on these events, each in its own way. This way the robots move in rhythm with the music. This will give the impression that they actually make the music. The robot band can have anything from 1 to 16 different musicians as Midi supports 16 different channels. 

## How can you participate?
Obviously the project needs robot musicians. Guitar players, Base players, drummers, horns, piano players, etc, etc. You could build a musician. If the robots are to play together they should have similar size and style. The project needs musician builders.
The project also needs software. On the PC it needs a program that can handle Midi and one that sends midi events to the different musicians. It also needs a program that helps to select a midi file, extract the instruments used by the file and that is able to link the instruments to robots. The project needs software developers.
